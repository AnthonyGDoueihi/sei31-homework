		<b>Born into the World</b> | <i>Dec 28, 1969</i> <br><br>
Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, and the grandson of poet Ole Torvalds. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, “I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character”, noting that this makes him half “Nobel Prize–winning chemist” and half “blanket-carrying cartoon character”
<br><br>At the age of 10 he began to dabble in computer programming on his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20. By the time he reached college, Torvalds considered himself an accomplished enough programmer to take on the Herculean task of creating an alternate operating system for his new PC.

		<b>From MINIX to Linux</b> | <i>Aug 1, 1991</i> <br><br>
In 1991, he purchased the Intel 80386-based IBM PC and obtained a MINIX operating system. With this, he began to work and research on the Linux operating system. Once he had completed a rough version of Linux, he posted a message on the Internet to alert other PC users to his new system. He made the software available for free downloading, and, as was a common practice among software developers at the time, he released the source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes. 

Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996. He graduated with a M.Sc. thesis titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.

Della Croce, Jr. to re-assign the Linux trademark to Linus Torvalds. The firm of Davis & Schroeder handles the case on an almost pro-bono basis.

<br><br><b>Offered Stock Options by Red Hat</b> | <i>May 1, 2001</i> <br><br>

		<b>Bitkeeper Causes Controversy</b> | <i>Jun 1, 2004</i> <br><br>
Linus Torvalds begins using BitMover’s BitKeeper to manage kernel development. Bitkeeper is proprietary software and many, including Richard Stallman, criticize the decision.
<br><br>
In June 2004, along with his family, he relocated to Beaverton, Oregon, where Open Source Development Labs was headquartered.

		<br><br><b>Creates "Git"</b> | <i>Jan 1, 2006</i> <br><br>
Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.
