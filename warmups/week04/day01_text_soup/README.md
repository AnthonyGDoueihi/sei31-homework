## Text Soup: Trump Edition

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript + jQuery, create a web page which prints a random word from a large sample of text, in a random position on the page, every 100 milliseconds.

#### Hints:
- Copy all of the text from the trump_tweets.txt file and paste the text into a hidden `<div>` element in your HTML file, and use jQuery to get the contents of the div.
- For reference you can find more presidential content at [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/)

#### Bonus:
- Fade the text in to make it appear, and then fade it out to disappear, to stop the page getting too dense with quality presidential twitter content.
- Try random colours, random font sizes, rotation, whatever floats your boat.
