At least 1 Google Font
Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
Keep your code clean and DRY
Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine


Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:
Why Joel admires them
Something Joel doesn't already know about them


Optional extras
Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Record and embed a short podcast or vlog about your favourite scientist
