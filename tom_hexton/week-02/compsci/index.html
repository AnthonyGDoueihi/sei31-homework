			<h4>what did he do?</h4>
			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>Mendax has been called the robin hood of hacking, instead of stealing money from the rich and poweful he's been stealing information and posting it online. Mendax, the founder of WikiLeaks, is none other than Australia's own Julian Assange. Assange, who began his foray into programming at the enviously early age of 16, quickly fell in love and promptly realised the potential for impact and not before he was 20 was he one of the founding member of a hacker group who claims they had US Military's computer networks under surveillance for close to 2 years. Sadly, he was busted but only ever changed lightly.</p>
